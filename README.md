# Vivaly Backend

This is the minimal backend for the Vivaly AU platform.

## How to run (locally or on Railway)

1. **Install dependencies**  

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your repo with at least:  

3. **Run the server locally (development):**  

4. **Build and start (for production):**  

## Routes

- `/api/auth` (register, login)
- `/api/jobs` (CRUD job posts)
- `/api/messages` (send/get messages)
- `/api/bookings` (create/view bookings)

All data is in-memory (no DB) for MVP/prototyping.  
Add a real DB when youâ€™re ready!

**Next:**  
- Connect this repo to Railway for live hosting  
- Continue to frontend build (for Netlify)
